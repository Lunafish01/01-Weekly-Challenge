# Horiseon-Accessibility-Project

## As a developer my main goal was to provide effective accessibilty elements to the website landing page and improve upon the existing CSS code by consolidating any repetitive code.

- I wanted to improve on the clients exisintg code to make the website accessible to all persons who may view it, regardless of visual or hearing imapairment. I also strive to keep any project I collaborate on clean and concise, by removing and consiolidating any repetitive code that may already be in place.

- I decided to build upon this project as a means to showcase my eye for detail and provide a seemless user experience for any person who may visit my clients site.

- The main issue addressed in this project is viewer accessibiilty, as those attributes were not already present in the existing code for this website. I was also able to clean up and consolidate the CSS file and remove any repetitive code.

- I was able to effectively identify proper HTML structure, the proper use for HTML semantic tags, proper nottion for edits and revisions in HTML. I have also learned how to identify CSS selectors, proper CSS notation, how to clean up and consolidate CSS code and proper notation for edits and revisions in CSS.
